# React Media Portal Application

### React Web Application NÂº 1

This react application fetches video data from Youtube Google API, on a dynamic search bases, and allows for a selection of 5 videos per search. 

In this react application, I've managed the concept of state in the overall App component and in the SearchBar component. 

Top level parent communication down to children has been achieved through callback functions and redux nor flux have been utilized. 

A minimal styling has been achieved through utilization of Bootstrap version 4. 

I've explored also the concept of controlled field component - where the value of an element is provided by state.
